# The Big Mac Index 


The Big Mac Index, a renowned publication by The Economist, offers an unconventional method for assessing the relative valuation of currencies across various countries. Instead of relying on traditional metrics, it measures each currency against a singular commodity: the ubiquitous Big Mac burger sold by McDonald's worldwide.

By comparing the prices of Big Macs in different countries in terms of US dollars, the index aims to illuminate discrepancies in currency valuations vis-Ã -vis the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of each respective nation.


By examining the disparities in Big Mac prices across multiple countries, the goal is to discern:
1. Whether the actual price of a Big Mac in a specific country aligns reasonably with its GDP per capita. This comparison offers insights into the relative affordability of the Big Mac within the context of each country's economic prosperity.
2. What the ideal price of a Big Mac should be, thereby indicating whether a country's currency is overvalued or undervalued relative to the US dollar. Deviations from this ideal price signal potential discrepancies in currency valuation, guiding assessments of exchange rate fairness.
3. The price trends of Big Macs between 2011 and 2021, providing a retrospective view of how currency values have evolved over the decade. Analyzing these trends can illuminate shifts in economic dynamics, including inflation rates, currency fluctuations, and purchasing power parity.
